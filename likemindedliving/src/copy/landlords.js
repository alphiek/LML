Whilst in our early stages of the business we initially entered the market through subletting to gain a foothold, we now no longer rent properties on a sublet basis. However, we spotted a greater need for providing a consultancy-based service for renters looking to move to London. We exist solely to provide renters with advice on where to live and who to live with.`

If we are in touch with you, this usually means one of our renters have indicated to us they would like to rent your property.`

                p: `We found from our subletting past that, sharers usually tend to pay more for properties due to the nature of the tenancy. Typically, in London, 86% of postcodes take up more than a third of professional’s take-home pay. For the most part this is due to sharers not fully utilising all the rental options that would be available to them. To that end, we built technology that searches across the market, literally through every street, to make sure renters find the best deal. We’ve found sharers can save an average of £1,500pa when they look for a property with us.`

We ask them to fill in our form which goes into further details on their property requirements and move-in date, this in turn triggers a property search within our dashboard to find suitable properties that meet their requirements. Renters then have a choice to select through their favourite properties, and we’ll organise a viewing on their behalf.  We love to work with estate agents or private landlords that can help us provide the perfect property to our customers. We are building London’s first community of flat-sharers all connected to each other by their like-minded traits, get in touch with us if you own or are managing a property that is suitable for sharers.`

In this phase, we’ll work closely with you to prepare the documents required to formally place an offer for your property. We’ll then collect a holding deposit from our tenants to ensure they are serious about placing an offer. We’ll formally present this offer to you alongside full information of our clients and it will be up to you to make the decision on whether or not to proceed. Once the offer has been accepted, we’ll transfer over to you the holding deposit we received, and take a backseat role as your new prospective tenant’s progress through your referencing phase. We’ll be on hand to answer any questions and provide support should we be needed, but our role will strictly be limited to such through to the tenancy being granted. As soon as the tenancy agreement is signed, welcome your new tenants to their home and of course we’ll still be there for assistance purposes.`

It started when Denzel , (Director) , visited my property and gave an appraisal and ever since then I have not looked back. In fact I have increased my portfolio with them and would suggest anyone having issues with their agents to use Like Minded Living. Even if you haven’t got a problem with your agent but want to try something different then again contact Denzel at Like Minded Living and you will not be disappointed. From being in regular contact regarding the property to paying rent on time , I have found the management team to be extremely efficient. They have dealt with any issues relating to my property quickly and with a minimum of fuss. I’m looking forward to continue with the business relationship and would recommend Like Minded Living to everyone whether you are a Tenant or a Landlord.`,
